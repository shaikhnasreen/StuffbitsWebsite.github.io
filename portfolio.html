         <h2><b>Soil Sensor Prototype</b></h2>
         <p> A simple soil parameters sensor display module was developed to evaluate the JXCT soil sensors over Modbus <br><br>
            Hardware has STM32 microcontroller, 2.8" TFT display and 4 keys. RS485 for communciation.<br>
            This evaluation board supports 4 different soil sensors as follows<br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>  JXBS-3001-NPK-RS Soil NPK</li>
              <li>  JXBS-3001-PH-RS Soil</li>
              <li>  JXBS-3001-TR-RS</li>
              <li>  JXBS-3001-TH--RS</li>
            </ul>

            This evaluation board can display readings from upto four different soil sensors simulataneously on differenet pages.<br>
            The Modbus Address for each device is settable and model can be selected from the above list.<br><br>

          <h2><b>Air Purifier Controller</b></h2>
          <p> Air purifiers essentially work by sanitizing the air by using electric air filters having high-voltage electrodes. <br><br>
             A very compact and low cost controller was developed for this purpose. In built SMPS so that device operates directly on 230VAC.<br>
             It has Relay output to control high-voltage electrodes. While a Triac based speed control is applied to 2 AC fans inside the unit.<br><br>
             It has 4 selectable modes on rotary switch and 3 selectable fan speed on rotary switch <br>

          <h2><b>Parking Sensor</b></h2>
          <p> The Parking Sensor overhead indicator system is a simple, cost-efficient and highly effective off-street parking management system.
            This system transforms the multi-storey parking experience for drivers by providing high-visibility, colour coded LED overhead guidance indicators that are dynamically
            controlled by your smart parking business rules, allowing users to see the availability of parking space.<br><br>
            The parking sensor is based on Ultra-Sonic sensor for Obstacle detection and use High wattage RGB Led for indication.<br>
            Upto 128 devices can be connected on Modbus at a time to get centralized reading of Parking space availability.<br>
            A PC configuration tool on Modbus was also developed to set initial thresholds and device ID, color code for these sensors.
